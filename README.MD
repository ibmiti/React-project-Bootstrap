 this will be the documentation of the app, explaining the steps in building


first off we will be using create-react-app to create a react app within our new directory ( this should come with virtualization and all dependencies)
      and then name that app
        <!--  this process uses npm - to install react app + yarn to fetch and install dependencies -->
        <!-- yarn also allows you to set up an live server to view your project  -->

next we are creating an asset directory which we will use to store our images
# React-project-Bootstrap
